## Sample Question: Quadratic Functions and Graphs

### Question Text
```
The graph below shows a quadratic function. Which of the following is the correct equation for this parabola?
```

### Graph Expression (type naturally!)
```
y=x^2-4x+3
```
**No LaTeX needed!** Just type `y=x^2-4x+3` and the live preview shows the graph instantly.

### Options
- **A (Correct):** y = x² - 4x + 3
- **B:** y = -x² + 4x - 3
- **C:** y = x² + 4x + 3
- **D:** y = 2x² - 4x + 3

### Explanation
```
The parabola opens upward (positive leading coefficient) and has x-intercepts at x=1 and x=3.
Using factored form: y = (x-1)(x-3) = x² - 4x + 3
The vertex is at (2, -1), which you can find by completing the square: y = (x-2)² - 1
```

## Another Example: Trigonometry with Diagram

### Question Text
```
In the right triangle shown below, if angle A = 30° and the hypotenuse = 10cm, what is the length of the opposite side?
```

### Image Upload
- Upload a clear diagram of a right triangle with labeled sides and angle

### Options
- **A (Correct):** 5 cm
- **B:** 8.66 cm
- **C:** 10 cm
- **D:** 5.77 cm

### Explanation
```
Using SOH CAH TOA, we need sin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse
sin(30°) = opposite/10
opposite = 10 × sin(30°) = 10 × 0.5 = 5 cm
```

## Example: Multiple Graphs

### Question Text
```
Which statement correctly describes the intersection points of y = x² and y = 2x?
```

### Graph Expression (multiple equations)
```
y=x^2
y=2x
```
Or on one line: `y=x^2; y=2x`

**Live preview shows both graphs!** Type naturally and see them update in real-time.

### Options
- **A (Correct):** They intersect at (0, 0) and (2, 4)
- **B:** They intersect at (0, 0) only
- **C:** They never intersect
- **D:** They intersect at (1, 1) and (3, 9)

### Explanation
```
To find intersection points, set x² = 2x
x² - 2x = 0
x(x - 2) = 0
So x = 0 or x = 2

When x = 0: y = 0
When x = 2: y = 4
Intersection points: (0, 0) and (2, 4)
```

## Tips for Creating Effective Questions

1. **Use graphs for:**
   - Visualizing functions and transformations
   - Comparing multiple equations
   - Showing points of intersection
   - Demonstrating domain and range

2. **Use images for:**
   - Geometric diagrams
   - Real-world scenarios (triangles, circles)
   - Data tables and charts
   - Annotated step-by-step solutions

3. **Combine both when:**
   - Question involves interpreting a static diagram
   - Students need to match equation to pre-drawn graph
   - Showing comparison between ideal and actual graphs

4. **Write clear explanations that:**
   - Show step-by-step working
   - Reference the graph or image
   - Explain common misconceptions
   - Link to relevant formulas or theorems
